<p>The NFL Super Bowl is only a few days away and I am actually feeling excited about it this year. As a curios person I cannot wait for a few more days to see the winner so I thought itâ€™d be interesting to try to predict the winner beforehand. I used <b>Python</b> and <b>RandomForest Classifier</b> to predict the winner, and then use Regressor to make a guess on the score. Here is my way to predict the Super Bowl outcome.</p>
